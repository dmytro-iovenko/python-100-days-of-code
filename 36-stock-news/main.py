# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

#Get yesterday's closing stock price

#Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day before yesterday.
diff_percent = round((difference / float(yesterday_closing_price)) * 100)

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 

## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.
